### Speakers
![Bram van Ginneken](/Bram_van_Ginneken2.jpg) </br>
Bram van Ginneken is Professor of Medical Image Analysis at Radboud University Medical Center and chairs the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group. He pioneered the concept of challenges (algorithm benchmarks) in medical image analysis, by organizing the first two challenge workshops in 2007 at one of the leading international conferences (MICCAI) in the field, after which many followed. He initiated and maintains https://grand-challenge.org/ that currently list over 150 challenges organized by various researchers in the field. He is the driving force behind the [COMIC](https://grand-challenge.org/Create_your_own_challenge/) (Consortium for Open Medical Image Computing) platform, to easily set up websites for challenges in biomedical images analysis. At this tutorial, he will share his experiences with challenges in the biomedical image analysis field.

Maria Eskevich is Central Office Coordinator at CLARIN ERIC (European Research Infrastructure for Language Resources and Technology). Since 2010 she has been highly interested in running the benchmarking evaluation campaigns for multimedia related tasks exploring how users can browse and discover intersting material within multimedia archives using both audio and visual features of the data. She has been organizer and co-organizer of many tasks (algorithm benchmarks) at MediaEval and TRECVID, including Rich Speech Retrieval (RSR) at MediaEval (2011), Search and Hyperlinking (S&H) at MediaEval (2012-2014), Search and Anchoring in Video Archives (SAVA) at MediaEval (2015), and Video Hyperlinking (LNK) at TRECVID (2015-present). At this tutorial, she will share her experiences with shared tasks for multimedia evaluation.
